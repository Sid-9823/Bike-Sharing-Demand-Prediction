BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW
<H1>DFG</H1>
Rental bikes have become an increasingly popular mode of transportation in urban areas, as they provide a convenient and eco-friendly alternative to traditional means of getting around. However, one of the key challenges in implementing rental bike schemes is ensuring a stable supply of bikes at all times. In order to address this issue, it is crucial to accurately predict the number of bikes required at different hours of the day.

In this project, I am using various machine learning regression models to analyze various factors that impact bike usage, such as temperature, season, rainfall, holidays, the number of rented bikes at different times of the day, etc. By taking these factors into account, it becomes possible to forecast demand and allocate resources accordingly, ensuring a steady supply of rental bikes and reducing wait times for users.
